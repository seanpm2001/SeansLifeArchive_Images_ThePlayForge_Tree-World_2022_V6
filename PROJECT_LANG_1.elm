-- About:
-- I decided to make Elm the main (first) project language for this project (Seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive/Images/ThePlayForge/Tree-World/2022/June) as this project is about a game that is about trees, and it only makes sense to dedicate a language like Elm to it (since Elm is also named after a tree) this project needs a language file, so it works.
